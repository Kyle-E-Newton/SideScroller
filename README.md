# SideScroller

This is a sidescroller in the style of mario, developed in C++ with the use of the SFML Library, for Programming Assignment 9 in Compter Science 122 at Washington State University.

This was created by Kyle Newton and Dustin Peters for the Spring 2018 Semester, as a proof of concept on inheritance as well as general programming knowledge.

While the project was not completed to a completley working state, much of what was used in this project is proof of concept and would be possible to update into a working state with some work.
